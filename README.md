# Non-Neutral-Plasma-Simulator

Used to computationally simulate a non-neutral plasma, while implementing a Quadrupole Ion Trap for ion confinement.
Implements Julia's differential equations package to solve coupled diff eq's at each timestep of simulation.
Creates an animation showing the plasma dynamics over time.

Ability to control:
- number of particles
- charge of particles
- initial positions
- dissipation
